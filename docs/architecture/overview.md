## Implementation Details

### Server Implementation
```python
class Server:
    def __init__(self):
        self.global_model = None
        self.connected_clients = []
        self.aggregation_round = 0
```

### Client Implementation
```python
class Client:
    def __init__(self, client_id):
        self.client_id = client_id
        self.local_model = None
        self.privacy_engine = None
```

### Privacy Engine Implementation
```python
class PrivacyEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.epsilon = 1.0
        self.delta = 1e-5
        self.mechanism = 'gaussian'
```

## Communication Protocol

1. **Model Distribution**
   - Server broadcasts global model
   - Clients receive and initialize local models

2. **Local Training**
   - Clients train on local data
   - Privacy mechanisms applied
   - Gradients/updates computed

3. **Secure Aggregation**
   - Encrypted updates sent to server
   - Server aggregates updates
   - New global model computed

## Security Considerations

1. **Data Protection**
   - Local data never leaves client devices
   - Encrypted communication channels
   - Secure model updates

2. **Privacy Guarantees**
   - ε-differential privacy
   - Secure multi-party computation
   - Gradient clipping

3. **Access Control**
   - Client authentication
   - Role-based permissions
   - API key management

## Performance Optimization

1. **Communication Efficiency**
   - Gradient compression
   - Selective parameter updates
   - Bandwidth optimization

2. **Computational Resources**
   - Adaptive batch sizing
   - Resource-aware scheduling
   - Caching mechanisms

## Monitoring and Analytics

1. **Training Metrics**
   - Model accuracy tracking
   - Loss monitoring
   - Privacy budget usage

2. **System Metrics**
   - Communication overhead
   - Resource utilization
   - Client participation

## Future Extensions
